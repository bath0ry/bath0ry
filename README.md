Hello everyone! Welcome to my Github profile.

I'm currently learning flutter/dart.

I look for new opportunities.

I'm studying for 10 months, Flutter/Dart . I had my contact with programming at age 13 in game development courses, but I started in Flutter because I liked it more and had a greater development challenge. In addition to being interested in technology since childhood, I see a giant future in app development.


I like to play games, skate, cook and program. :)
